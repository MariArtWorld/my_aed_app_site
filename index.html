      <h5 >What it is Sudden Cardiac Arrest</h5>

  <p>Cardiac arrest is a sudden stop in effective blood flow due to the failure of the heart to contract effectively. Symptoms include loss of consciousness and abnormal or absent breathing. Some people may have chest pain, shortness of breath, or nausea before this occurs. If not treated within minutes, death usually occurs.

  The most common cause of cardiac arrest is coronary artery disease. Less common causes include major blood loss, lack of oxygen, very low potassium, heart failure, and intense physical exercise. A number of inherited disorders may also increase the risk including long QT syndrome. The initial heart rhythm is most often ventricular fibrillation. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding no pulse.</p>

  <h5>The Heart Responder App</h5>
  <p>When confronting an emergency such a cardiac arrest or any other emergency where CPR and a AED is necesary, it is not always easy to stay calm and do everything that it is necesary. An emergency of this kind can happend anywhere, to anybody, it is not always going to be the case that the emergency service are quick enogh, or are able to tell us where the closest AED is. Or if they can tell us, we might not be familiar  with the area, or be too nervous to think straight. It is in such a cases that the Heart  responder app make itself imprescindible. We want to help Irish people to have the peace of mind that, whatever happend,  they and their loved ones will have the best chance.</p>
